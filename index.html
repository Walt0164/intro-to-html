        <p>Hey there, Im Emma! I am first year college student at Algonquin College. Some simple facts about are I always loved all forms of art from a young age, and with that in mind, I knew I wanted to do something with art in college, Graphic design was the perfect fit between my love for photography and digital work. I love realism and photography so much that I started my business this summer to incorporate all of my skills. </p>

        <p>I love adventure and the thrill of all things. I am a competitive barrel racer and love anything outdoors. I play for the Algonquin Wolves basketball team and love to excel at anything I do.  </p>
